# Usage Patterns

**Purpose**: Common patterns for using `riotplan` via CLI and Library.

## Plan Directory Structure

RiotPlan expects a specific directory structure for a plan. The directory name becomes the plan code.

```
my-feature/
├── my-feature-prompt.md     # Meta-prompt (initial planning prompt)
├── SUMMARY.md               # Overview of the approach
├── EXECUTION_PLAN.md        # Detailed execution strategy
├── STATUS.md                # Current state tracking
├── plan/                    # Step files directory
│   ├── 01-analysis.md
│   ├── 02-design.md
│   ├── 03-implementation.md
│   ├── 04-testing.md
│   └── 05-documentation.md
└── analysis/                # Analysis output (optional)
```

## CLI Usage

### Interactive Plan Creation (Recommended)

For guided plan creation, use the `create` command:

```bash
# Start interactive creation
riotplan create my-feature

# Skip analysis, generate directly
riotplan create my-feature --direct

# Force analysis phase
riotplan create my-feature --analyze

# Specify number of steps
riotplan create my-feature --direct --steps 3
```

#### The Create Flow

The `create` command guides you through plan creation:

1. **Name & Description**: Provide a name and describe what you want to accomplish
2. **Mode Selection**: Choose analysis-first or direct generation
3. **Elaboration** (if analysis mode): Refine requirements iteratively
4. **Generation**: Create plan files from analysis or prompt
5. **Next Steps**: Get guidance on what to do next

#### Analysis Mode

Analysis mode is recommended for complex plans:

```bash
riotplan create complex-feature --analyze
```

This creates an `analysis/` directory with:
- `REQUIREMENTS.md` - Elaborated requirements
- `prompts/` - Saved elaboration feedback

Use `riotplan elaborate` to add feedback:

```bash
riotplan elaborate ./complex-feature
riotplan elaborate ./complex-feature -m "Quick feedback"
```

When ready, mark analysis complete and generate:

```bash
riotplan analysis ready ./complex-feature
riotplan generate ./complex-feature
```

#### Direct Mode

For straightforward plans, skip analysis:

```bash
riotplan create simple-fix --direct
```

This generates the plan immediately from your description.

#### Amending Plans

After generation, use `amend` for structural feedback:

```bash
riotplan amend ./my-feature
riotplan amend ./my-feature -m "Step 03 should come before 02"
riotplan amend ./my-feature -s 02 -m "Add more detail"
```

Amendments are saved to `amendments/` for reference.

#### Create vs Init

| Command | Use Case |
|---------|----------|
| `riotplan create` | Guided, interactive creation with analysis |
| `riotplan init` | Quick scaffolding for programmatic use |

#### Prompt Preservation

All inputs are saved for recovery:
- Initial prompt → `<name>-prompt.md`
- Elaborations → `analysis/prompts/XXX-feedback.md`
- Amendments → `amendments/XXX-feedback.md`

If interrupted, you can resume where you left off.

### Quick Plan Scaffolding

For programmatic or quick scaffolding, use `init`:

```bash
# Create a basic plan
riotplan init my-feature

# Create with description
riotplan init my-feature --description "Implement user authentication"

# Create with specific number of steps
riotplan init my-feature --steps 5
```

### Checking Plan Status

```bash
# Show status of plan in current directory
riotplan status

# Show status of specific plan
riotplan status ./prompts/my-feature

# Verbose output with all details
riotplan status -v

# Output as JSON for scripting
riotplan status --json
```

### Listing Steps

```bash
# List all steps
riotplan list

# List only pending steps
riotplan list --pending
```

Example output:
```
✅ 01 analysis
✅ 02 design
🔄 03 implementation
⬜ 04 testing
⬜ 05 documentation
```

### Executing Steps

```bash
# Execute the next pending step
riotplan execute

# Execute a specific step
riotplan execute 03

# Preview what would be executed
riotplan execute --dry-run
```

### Resuming Plans

```bash
# Resume from STATUS.md
riotplan resume

# Skip any failed steps
riotplan resume --skip-failed

# Resume from a specific step
riotplan resume --from 03
```

## Library Usage

### Loading a Plan

```typescript
import { loadPlan } from 'riotplan';

const plan = await loadPlan('./prompts/my-feature');

console.log(plan.metadata.code);     // 'my-feature'
console.log(plan.metadata.name);     // 'My Feature Implementation'
console.log(plan.state.status);      // 'in_progress'
console.log(plan.state.currentStep); // 3
console.log(plan.state.progress);    // 40 (percentage)
```

### Creating a Plan

```typescript
import { createPlan } from 'riotplan';

const plan = await createPlan({
    code: 'user-auth',
    name: 'User Authentication',
    path: './prompts/user-auth',
    description: 'Implement secure user authentication',
    steps: [
        { title: 'Requirements Analysis', description: 'Gather and document requirements' },
        { title: 'Security Design', description: 'Design authentication flow' },
        { title: 'Implementation', description: 'Build the authentication system' },
        { title: 'Testing', description: 'Write tests and verify security' },
        { title: 'Documentation', description: 'Document the system' }
    ]
});
```

### Working with Steps

```typescript
import { loadPlan, executeStep, updatePlanState } from 'riotplan';

const plan = await loadPlan('./prompts/my-feature');

// Get pending steps
const pendingSteps = plan.steps.filter(s => s.status === 'pending');

// Execute a step
const result = await executeStep(plan, 3, {
    logger: console,
    // Optional: LLM execution context
});

// Update state after completion
const updatedPlan = updatePlanState(plan, 3, result);
```

### Resuming Execution

```typescript
import { loadPlan, resumePlan } from 'riotplan';

const plan = await loadPlan('./prompts/my-feature');

// Resume from current state
const result = await resumePlan(plan, {
    logger: console,
    skipFailed: false
});

console.log(result.success);          // true
console.log(result.completedSteps);   // [3, 4, 5]
console.log(result.duration);         // 12500 (ms)
```

## STATUS.md Format

The STATUS.md file tracks plan progress:

```markdown
# My Feature - Execution Status

## Current State

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Status** | `in_progress` |
| **Current Step** | 03-implementation |
| **Last Completed** | 02-design |
| **Started At** | 2026-01-08 |
| **Last Updated** | 2026-01-10 |

## Step Progress

| Step | Name | Status | Started | Completed | Notes |
|------|------|--------|---------|-----------|-------|
| 01 | Analysis | ✅ Completed | 2026-01-08 | 2026-01-08 | - |
| 02 | Design | ✅ Completed | 2026-01-08 | 2026-01-09 | Revised twice |
| 03 | Implementation | 🔄 In Progress | 2026-01-09 | - | 50% done |
| 04 | Testing | ⬜ Pending | - | - | - |
| 05 | Documentation | ⬜ Pending | - | - | - |

## Blockers

_No blockers currently._

## Issues

- Minor: Need to decide on session storage strategy

## Notes

Implementation is progressing well. May need to add step 06 for deployment.
```

## Status Indicators

| Symbol | Status | Meaning |
|--------|--------|---------|
| ⬜ | `pending` | Not started |
| 🔄 | `in_progress` | Currently active |
| ✅ | `completed` | Done |
| ❌ | `failed` | Failed with error |
| ⏸️ | `blocked` | Waiting on dependency |
| ⏭️ | `skipped` | Intentionally skipped |

## Plan Verification

RiotPlan includes verification to catch common planning and execution gaps.

### The Verification Problem

Without verification:
- Plans may miss requirements from the analysis
- Execution may skip steps or complete them partially
- "I forgot" - the AI gets halfway and misses things

### Verification Commands

```bash
# Full verification (recommended)
riotplan verify ./my-plan

# Check plan covers analysis requirements
riotplan verify ./my-plan --analysis

# Check execution is complete
riotplan verify ./my-plan --execution

# Show all verification criteria
riotplan verify ./my-plan --criteria

# JSON output for scripting
riotplan verify ./my-plan --json
```

### Setting Up Verification Criteria

Add a "Verification Criteria" section to your `analysis/REQUIREMENTS.md`:

```markdown
## Verification Criteria

### Must Have (Plan Fails Without)
- [ ] User authentication endpoint exists
- [ ] Session tokens have 24hr expiry
- [ ] Passwords are hashed with bcrypt

### Should Have (Plan Incomplete Without)
- [ ] Rate limiting on auth endpoints
- [ ] Login audit logging

### Could Have (Nice to Have)
- [ ] Remember me functionality
```

Criteria are weighted by priority:
- **Must Have**: 100% weight (critical)
- **Should Have**: 70% weight (important)
- **Could Have**: 30% weight (nice to have)

### Understanding Verification Output

#### Coverage Report (Analysis to Plan)

```
Verification: Analysis → Plan Alignment

✅ COVERED (5):
   • Authentication flow requirements → Steps 01-03
   
⚠️  PARTIAL (2):
   • Logging requirements → Step 04 (only error logging)
   
❌ MISSING (1):
   • Rate limiting requirement → Not found

Alignment Score: 78%
```

#### Completion Report (Plan to Execution)

```
Verification: Plan → Execution Alignment

✅ Step 01 - Analysis
⚠️  Step 02 - Implementation
   ❌ API endpoints not tested
❌ Step 03 - Testing
   ⚠️  Marked as Complete but criteria not met

Execution Completeness: 45%
```

### When to Verify

Run verification at key points:
1. **After generating a plan**: Catch missing requirements early
2. **Before execution**: Confirm plan is ready
3. **During execution**: Track progress
4. **After completion**: Confirm everything was done

### Verification vs Validation

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `riotplan validate` | Check plan structure is correct |
| `riotplan verify` | Check plan content addresses requirements |

### Tips for Effective Verification

1. **Be specific in criteria**: "API returns 200 on success" is better than "API works"
2. **Use priority levels**: Focus on Must Have first
3. **Check acceptance criteria in steps**: These become verification targets
4. **Run verification often**: Catch drift early
